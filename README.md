This code implements the transparent neural network architecture described at https://mac-n.github.io

This is still a work in progress. Tidying up and pruning of branches is ongoing. 

You can run the main experiment with python run_experiments.py. 

The branch with the hierarchical variation is found at hierarchy_patterns with the appropriate variation of experiment_harness.py

The code that works best with lorenz data is called discrete_predictive_net.py. This is a very confusing accident of the evolution of this architecture, so i apologise if you see this. will fix it asap

The code for different visualisations is currently scattered throughout branches, Refactoring for different data types/ different architecture combinations is ongoing.
